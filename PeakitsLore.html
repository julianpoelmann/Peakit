A land of stone and fire called Ignivores, guarded by the Fire Elder Yvor who uses purple fire magic. A forest and plant land called Sylvana, guarded and dominated by the Elder Peakit Terrian and a water land called Ocya, guarded by the water Elder Liquana. 
<br>The Elder Peakits who guard every land are very large, beautifully sublime, wise and just. They get very old and create new colonies every 100 years. These are "pure Peakits" and are usually a little bigger and stronger than normal ones.</p>

Human-made Peakits are Mechakits. Originally they were invented to fulfill missions, for example building bridges and houses, protect the earth from asteroids or small variations of Chromakits/Mechakits should help in the household. (Like a smol dog- Alexa assistent or like a watchdog or a Maid) but were increasingly used as weapons to fight other people and creatures. Mechakits are really hated by the Elder ones bc they are "unnatural". Minikits are more the real watchdogs or pets. Minikits are not able to speak.</p>

                            <strong>Peakit Traits</strong></h4>
                        <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Peakits are actually peaceful, can communicate with people and other beings, are intelligent and are considered a rare species from a rare world. Some of them are Guardians of a city or are considered gods and are worshiped. Humans also have Cults and Clubs for some known Peakits. Others work with humans. Others live alone and still others prefer to be separated in the Elder Nest because they don't trust humans. 
<br>
<br>The Orb and- CPS
<br>The Orb is usually very important for the healthy state of a Peakit. If it is destroyed, it also destroys a part of the Peakit. They are in severe pain, that can be healed over the time. Without an orb they can no longer use magic, the Peacock-Fan tail remains closed forever and the Orb they had cannot be replaced.<br></p>

                            <strong>CPS - Corrupted Peakit Syndrome</strong></h4>
                        <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">there is a disease that can only attack Peakits. It´s called the Corrupted Peakit SyndromeCPS.
<br>This disease is very rare and very dangerous. Only a few Peakits survive. Because it is pain, self-destruction and losing the mind that destroys this species .This disease breaks the magic Orb or crack it, the Eyes and their blood turn black and they lose the ability to speak, moan and stutter a lot more. They turn into wild beasts.
<br>These are then Corrupted Peakits.
<br>
<br>Elder-ones and pure Peakits can not get sick of this disease. It is a Human-made disease that only affects impure Peakits since impure Peakits lack the immunity of the Elder
<br>
<br>They then also become cannibals. Are very destructive and aggressive. Corrupted Peakits rarely retain their speaking skills. If so, their voices sound creepily deep and as if three voices were speaking. When a Peakit is infected by the virus, it normally loses its magic.
<br>If a Corrupted Peakit keeps its magic even if the Orb is broken, it belongs to the S-CPS Class. The aggression only makes the magic stronger as before. There are trained Peakits and medical Mechakits that can drive the virus out, similar to an exorcism. After a Corrupted Peakit has been healed, it has lost its Orb forever. Only very rarely, when the Orb is only slightly damaged, a Peakit can learn to use its magic again but its never as strong as before anymore. As long as the Orb hasn't split in two.&nbsp;</p>

                        <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Peakits can be male, female, or non-gender. They reproduce like any other mammal, although it seems more human like how tenderly and lovingly they treat each other while mating. Unlike most mammals, Peakits lay 1 - 2 ostrich like large eggs after a pregnancy of 9 months, each of which has to be hatched for another 3 months. Pure and impure Peakits can mate but always get impure Children. Peakits years are slower than Human years. One Peakit year is 5 human years. Peakit Children learn their magic when they are 13 Peakityears. They form their own Orb. When the Orb is formed, Peakit can start training their true magicians and open their tail. But that also takes time and training. It's like the transition to being an adult. Youth consecration or recognition. If a Peakit child cannot form an Orb at the age of 13 then they will never be able to use their magicians properly. The tail remains closed. Many Peakits see other Peakits without Orb and magic as handicapped. Unfortunately, this is a common reason for bullying in the world of Peakits. </p>
